# PATH-FINDER
Obstacle avoidance is one of the most important aspects of mobile robotics.Here obstacle avoidance is  by  using ultrasonic sensors, 
It will move in a particular direction and avoid the obstacle which is comming in its path.

Path finder uses  ultrasonic sensors for detecting any particle or obstacle which comes in the radius of ultrasonic sensor and the  changes its  path when it approaches near it .
This path finder is applicable in numerous ways it reduces the human effort and if implemented in cars or any other automobiles may reduce the risk  of accidents .
The updated model of this can be impleted in satellites and many other space  vechiles to reduce the risk of collision with astroides and other space junk .
This path finder can be used in the wheel chair of people whonare completely disabled i mean the people who can use their hands and legs 
This path finder will locate the obsctacle in the path and will change its path .
The two way DC motor is used for the two wheels which are the main transoprt of the pathfinder.
The wries are used for connecting all the nine components of the path finder.
The servo motor is used for rotation mechanism of the pathfinder for 360 degree roation .
